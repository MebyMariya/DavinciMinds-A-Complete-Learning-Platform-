# The World of Numbers

##  A Journey Through Number Systems

- **Natural Numbers:** These are the counting numbers (1, 2, 3...), used for everyday counting.  The name "Google" itself originates from a natural number (10<sup>100</sup>).

- **Whole Numbers:**  Natural numbers plus zero (0, 1, 2, 3...). Introduced to represent nothingness.

- **Integers:** Whole numbers and their negative counterparts (-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3...).  Developed to address quantities below zero.

- **Rational Numbers:** Numbers expressible as a fraction of two integers (e.g., 1/2, -5/9, 0.7, 0.333...). This includes decimals that terminate or repeat.

- **Irrational Numbers:** Numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers (e.g., π, √2, the golden ratio).  These are non-repeating, non-terminating decimals.  The discovery of irrational numbers, particularly √2, was famously met with hostility by Pythagoras.

- **Real Numbers:** This encompasses all the above number types – natural, whole, integers, rational, and irrational numbers. These are the numbers commonly used in everyday life.
